<PRE><h2 align="LEFT">THIS IS MY PAGE, BARRING THE INFO 
FROM THE LINKS PROVIDED, 
I USUALLY STAY CONFUSED AND WELL WHO DOESN'T,
THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LESS TIME.
I LOVE ALL THE MENTIONED: ANIME,MANGA,MOVIES,NOVELS.
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY CONTACTS BUT WHO HAS THE TIME
(I'M TALKING ABOUT U)
I STARTED PLAYING BADMINTON IN CLASS 8 AND AM STILL BY 
HEADING THE COLLEGE TEAM. I AM ALSO A YOGA ENTHUSIAST.

I AM AN AVID READER OF BOTH MANGA AND NOVELS.
I'VE RECOMMNEDED SOME, AND I HOPE U TRY THEM.
THE ONE MENTIONED HERE IS MY FAV. IT'S STORY IS AN 
UNFORGETFUL ONE AND REALLY WILL GET IMPRINTED ON UR HEART.
RECENTLY STARTED THE CLIFTON CHRONICLES AND BECAME AN 
INSTANT JEFFREY ARCHER FAN.

I STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT I WANNA BECOME......
BUT THIS COLLEGE IS MY CUP OF TEA THAT'S FOR SURE.
THE FILM INDUSTRY REALLY EXCITES ME,
I DON'T ASPIRE OF ACTING 
BUT BARRING ACTING THERE'S SO MUCH TO DO.
THE ACTORS ON MY LEFT ARE THE ONES WHOM I 
GREATLY ADMIRE
